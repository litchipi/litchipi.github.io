## Introduction

In this post I will present a little Nix library made to build web applications
the proper way.

The idea is to **always** keep it simple for the developper and have a nice API,
but still do the job.

As this is a first step only, and only tailored to my personnal needs,
for now it's limited.
But the whole purpose of this project is to gather contributions for as many
backends and frontends possibilities as possible.

## Building the backend

Blah blah blah

## Building the frontend

Blah blah blah

## Starting a database

In order to test easily the backend locally

Can be used in production as well, but separated in purpose to allow usage of
NixOS configuration of database or remote database
