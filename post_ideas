Create your own luks encryption tool:
  - Explain how dm-crypt and cryptsetup works with the kernel crypto API, how a mapper works, and what we'll do
  Build your own by:
    - Create a filesystem mapper
    - Mount our own filesystem and use it in a kind-of /dev/mapper
    - Encrypt the filesystem with `orion` (https://lib.rs/crates/orion) with no-std
    - Create a kernel module (in Rust) to unlock the partition

    - Nixify the build
    - Add the kernel module to a NixOS configuration, and boot the config
      - Add grub configuration, insert the kernel module, load initramfs
      - Get the password prompt in boot
